### Breaking changes

- [\#60](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/r1cs-std/pull/60) Rename `AllocatedBit` to `AllocatedBool` for consistency with the `Boolean` variable.
  You can update downstream usage with `grep -rl 'AllocatedBit' . | xargs env LANG=C env LC_CTYPE=C sed -i '' 's/AllocatedBit/AllocatedBool/g'`.
- [\#65](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/r1cs-std/pull/65) Rename `Radix2Domain` in `r1cs-std` to `Radix2DomainVar`.

### Features

- [\#53](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/r1cs-std/pull/53) Add univariate evaluation domain and Lagrange interpolation. 

### Improvements

- [\#65](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/r1cs-std/pull/65) Add support for non-constant coset offset in `Radix2DomainVar`.
